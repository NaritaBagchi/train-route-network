*Install JDK (JDK8 recommended)
*Install sbt (https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Setup.html)
*On Windows – 
	*Ensure java is set in the path
	*Ensure sbt is set in the path 
	*cd <to the Project folder>
	*run sbt 
	*Within sbt environment, run the following - 
		*clean
		*compile
		*run <arguments>
	*About <arguments> 
		*arg[0] represents the stations. For the given problem, ABCDE are the stations.
		*arg[1] represents the routes. For the given problem, AB5,BC4,CD8,DC8,DE6,AD5,CE2,EB3,AE7 are the routes.
		*arg[2] represents the expression according to a problem statement. 
	*Details of arg[2] - It follows the following format - <ProblemType>_<Path>-<LimitType>-<LimitValue>
		*ProblemType - The program categorises the problems into 3 types. Possible values for ProblemType are Distance , AllRoutes and ShortestDistance.
			*Distance – Represents the problem to compute distance between the given path.
			*AllRoutes – Represents the problem to compute all possible routes between the given pair of stations.
			*ShortestDistance - Represents the problem to compute the shortest distance between the given pair of stations.
		*Path – Represents the path. Hyphen/Minus (-) is used as the delimiter.
		*LimitType – Possible values are Hops, Exact, and Distance.
		*LimitValue – Represent the value used by LimitType to limit the conditionals.

*List of arguments for the given set of problems –
<graph> = ABCDE AB5,BC4,CD8,DC8,DE6,AD5,CE2,EB3,AE7
